# Epicmak
A keyboard layout designed to be Slow and uncomfortable to type on, Based on Vitrimak.
This keyboard layout was created because of speed claims about more efficient layouts than QWERTY
such as Colemak and Dvorak, Anecdotally people agree that Colemak and Dvorak are more comfortable than QWERTY
to type with but the fastest typists (on 10fastfingers.com) self reportedly use the QWERTY
layout we are all familar with.

This is where Epicmak comes in, it's a layout made with the express purpose of making the top 200 words
(and hopefully more) as slow and uncomfortable as possible.
